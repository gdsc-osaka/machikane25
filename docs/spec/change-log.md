# Machikane Festival Change Log

## 2025-10-16 â€” Stamp Rally Guest Experience bootstrap
- Branch `001-product-requirement-document` created to deliver the stamp rally specification, plan, and task breakdown.
- NFC signage: print five dedicated tags (`reception`, `photobooth`, `art`, `robot`, `survey`) pointing to `https://fes2025.gdsc-osaka.jp/stamp?token=<TOKEN>` and mount them at the corresponding stations before the festival opens.
- Reminder for operations: keep the signage token list in 1Password and update Remote Config if tokens rotate.
