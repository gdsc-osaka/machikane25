# Tasks: Stamp Rally Web Experience

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-a-stamp/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Include Vitest and integration tasks that deliver 100% statement and branch coverage for the scope in line with the Exhaustive Testing Mandate.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `apps/stamp/src/` houses feature code, `apps/stamp/test/` holds Vitest suites, shared assets live under `packages/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Setup (Phase 1)** ‚Üí precedes Foundational tasks.
- **Foundational (Phase 2)** ‚Üí required before any user story work.
- **User Story 1 (P1)** ‚Üí unlocks anonymously authenticated progress tracking (MVP).
- **User Story 2 (P2)** ‚Üí depends on US1 completion for eligibility data.
- **User Story 3 (P3)** ‚Üí depends on US2 for QR payload semantics.
- **Polish Phase** ‚Üí runs after stories converge.

## Parallel Opportunities

- Setup tasks T001‚ÄìT004 can run in parallel after aligning scope.
- Foundational tasks T005‚ÄìT009 are parallelizable once Firebase config path is agreed.
- In US1, tasks T014 and T017 can proceed alongside UI updates after validation helper exists.
- In US2, tasks T024‚ÄìT026 allow concurrent UI work while server eligibility is finalized.
- In US3, tasks T032 and T033 can be implemented concurrently once auth guard (T030) ships.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Complete Setup & Foundational tasks to solidify Firebase, Remote Config, SWR, and monitoring scaffolding.
2. Ship User Story 1 as the MVP (anonymous sign-in, NFC awarding, progress UI, bilingual messaging).
3. Layer in User Story 2 to unlock surveys and QR rewards; validate forms and QR output with festival hardware.
4. Finish with User Story 3 for admin redemption control and duplicate prevention.
5. Execute Polish phase for documentation, performance validation, coverage exports, and UX copy review before release.
