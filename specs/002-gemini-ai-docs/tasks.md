# Tasks: AI Photo Booth Experience

**Input**: Design docs from /specs/002-gemini-ai-docs/
**Prerequisites**: `plan.md`, `spec.md`, `data-model.md`, `Design Doc.md`

**Tests**: Vitest + Testing Library suites and Playwright coverage that achieve 100% statement/branch metrics for all touched modules.

**Organization**: Tasks follow TDD and DDD layering, grouped so each user story can ship independently once its tests pass.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can progress in parallel (no shared files or blocking dependencies)
- **[Story]**: SETUP, FOUND, US1, US2, US3, POLISH
- Reference concrete file paths and Firebase resources

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

- [ ] T101 [P] [SETUP] Register `apps/photo` in `turbo.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and root `package.json` scripts (`dev:photo`, `build:photo`, `test:photo --filter photo`).
- [ ] T102 [SETUP] Scaffold `apps/photo/` baseline (Next.js app router folders, `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `biome.json`, Tailwind/PostCSS config, README) mirroring `plan.md` structure (src/app, src/domain, src/application, src/infra, src/components).
- [ ] T103 [P] [SETUP] Add per-app configs (`firebase.json`, `firestore.rules`, `firestore.indexes.json`, `storage.rules`, `tsconfig.test.json`, Vitest + Playwright setup) under `apps/photo/`.

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core DDD layers, Firebase wiring, and security rules needed before user stories.

- [ ] T201 [P] [FOUND] Create failing domain spec `apps/photo/test/unit/domain/booth.test.ts` (covering Booth state transitions from data-model.md) and `photo.test.ts` (covering GeneratedPhoto, UploadedPhoto).
- [ ] T202 [FOUND] Implement domain modules (`src/domain/booth.ts`, `src/domain/photo.ts`, `src/domain/options.ts`) with pure functions and types based on `data-model.md` to satisfy T201.
- [ ] T203 [P] [FOUND] Author failing converter tests `apps/photo/test/unit/infra/firestoreConverters.test.ts` validating Firestore 竊・domain mapping for booths, generatedPhotos, uploadedPhotos, options.
- [ ] T204 [FOUND] Implement Firestore FirestoreDataConverter and repositories in `src/infra/firebase/firestore/**` plus dependency-free `src/application/repositories.ts` interfaces to pass T203.
- [ ] T205 [P] [FOUND] Add failing auth tests `apps/photo/test/unit/infra/firebaseAuth.test.ts` ensuring anonymous sign-in (for visitors) and admin token verification (for staff) logic.
- [ ] T206 [FOUND] Build `apps/photo/src/libs/firebase/client.ts` (client SDK) and `server.ts` (Admin SDK) exporting memoized Firebase clients (Auth, Firestore, Storage) with emulator support.
- [ ] T207 [P] [FOUND] Write failing GenerationOption loader tests `apps/photo/test/unit/application/generationOptions.test.ts` (TDD for GenerationService).
- [ ] T208 [FOUND] Implement GenerationService (`src/application/generationService.ts`) to load options collection from Firestore (per `data-model.md`) to satisfy T207.
- [ ] T209 [P] [FOUND] Add failing GenerationService tests `apps/photo/test/unit/application/generationService.gemini.test.ts` covering Gemini API request schema (msw mock).
- [ ] T210 [FOUND] Extend GenerationService (`src/application/generationService.ts`) and `src/infra/gemini/client.ts` to handle AI generation requests (FR-003) passing T209.
- [ ] T211 [P] [FOUND] Create Firebase security regression tests `apps/photo/test/integration/firestoreRules.test.ts` + `storageRules.test.ts` asserting access policies (per Design Doc - admin R/W, anonymous R/W for specific paths).
- [ ] T212 [FOUND] Author `apps/photo/firestore.rules`, `storage.rules`, and emulator seed scripts ensuring anonymous attendees and admin (Custom Claim) roles, satisfying T211.
- [ ] T213 [FOUND] Implement AuthService (`src/application/authService.ts`) and `src/infra/firebase/authAdmin.ts` for admin token validation and custom token creation (per Design Doc).
- [ ] T214 [FOUND] Implement Next.js Middleware `apps/photo/src/middleware.ts` (TDD) using AuthService to protect admin routes (/admin, /photos).
- [ ] T215 [FOUND] Seed shared presentation primitives (`src/components/ui/Button.tsx`, `src/components/layout/KioskShell.tsx`) and i18n setup (`src/libs/i18n/`).

**Checkpoint**: Foundational TDD suites green; user stories can start.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Phase Dependencies**: Setup 竊・Foundational 竊・User Stories (US1 can start only after Foundational). US2 and US3 depend on US1 data contracts but can proceed in parallel once US1 API surfaces stabilize.
- **Within Stories**: Tests (笞EE precede implementation; ensure BoothService (T305) and useBoothState (T307) are implemented early in US1 as Control Page (T309) and Display Page (T308) depend heavily on them.
- **Parallel Opportunities**: Tasks marked [P] can proceed concurrently. US2 and US3 UI workstreams can run in parallel after their respective API services are stubbed.
